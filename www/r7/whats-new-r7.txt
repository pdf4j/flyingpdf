 - Complete rewrite of table support.  Current table support includes:
   - Floated tables
   - display: inline-table
   - display: table-caption (caption in (X)HTML)
   - display: table-header-group, display: table-row-group, and
table-footer-group (thead, tbody, and tfoot in (X)HTML)
   - table-layout: fixed
   - table-layout: auto (complete support, see below)
   - Table box construction and layout follows the same code path as
everything else
   - display: table-column and display: table-column-group (col and
colgroup in (X)HTML)
   - vertical-align in table cells
   - Full support for anonymous tables (with the exception that a
table-column-group element won't force a table to be created.  This
turned out to be awkward to implement [and marginally useful it would
seem...])
